# creditflow

All the Architecture was design using draw.io. Please open using it. 

- * CreditMap: * contains the general idea behind credit evalution.
- * Level 1: * contains the flow for onboard with data loading abd integration.
- * On board: * contains the details and knock out rules for the credit risk.
 

## Question for the interview:
- will the customer only be evaluated during the onboard or there will be other situations ( application, behaviour)?
- I couldn't find the details of the SEON API. What is the focus of KYC? only biometrics? will documents be validated?
- Address, phone number age and other information will be validated besides biometrics?
- Are Letigation and international lists (interpol) not being consumed? 
- Is the credit score developed internally or it will be retrieved from Experian?
- Credit card limit are usully defined base on risk and number of incomes. Eg. 2 * income.... are other formulas possible?
